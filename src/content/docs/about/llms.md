title: About LLMs
description: My thoughts about Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.

LLMs are great tools, but that's it. They are tools.

And like any tool, they can be used well or poorly. Especially poorly when the user is not aware of their limitations.
For junior developers, they can be a crutch that prevents them from learning the fundamentals of programming.
LLMs do not understand code, they just predict the next token based on the input.
They have no idea about the context, the intent, or the consequences of their output.
And they can give users illusions of competence, which is very dangerous.

LLMs are not a replacement for human thinking (at least not yet).
We don't even know what "thinking" really is on the fundamental level.
