### Know Before You Delegate

Delegation fails when you assign tasks you don’t understand.
If you wouldn’t know how to do it, don’t expect others to succeed blindly.

When facing an unfamiliar problem, you have at least two paths:

- **Learn first**: Research and figure out the solution, or at least approach to solution yourself.
- **Delegate exploration**: Define a research spike with strict time limits and clear objectives.

For complex tasks, break them down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. Clarity and structure are non-negotiable.
