### Know Before You Delegate

Delegation fails when you assign tasks you don’t understand.
If you wouldn’t know how to do it, don’t expect others to succeed blindly.

When facing an unfamiliar problem, you have at least two paths:

- **Learn first**: Research and figure out the solution, or at least approach to solution yourself.
- **Delegate exploration**: Define a research spike with strict time limits and clear objectives.

For complex tasks, break them down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. Clarity and structure are non-negotiable.

### Evaluate People by Value

Organizations often overemphasize technical proficiency as the primary metric for individual worth. This is flawed.
Technical skills can be skewed by access to training, self-promotion, or presentation style.
They rarely reflect actual outcomes.

True value lies in measurable impact on delivery and support.
Delivery ensures commitments are met; support sustains operational stability and team cohesion.
These factors drive resilience and performance.

Technical expertise is a tool, not an end goal—and difficult to quantify in isolation.
Elevating individuals based on optics or niche skillsets creates structural fragility.
Value must be anchored in execution and systemic support, not perception.
