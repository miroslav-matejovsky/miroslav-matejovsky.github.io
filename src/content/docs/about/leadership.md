- When assigning tasks you should know how you would do them yourself.
If you wouldn't know how to do it, you can't expect others to do it.

- When you don't know how to approach a problem, you have at least two options:
  - Research and learn how to solve it yourself first.
  - Define a "research task" or spike for someone else to explore possible solutions.
    Ideally with limited time and clear goals.

- If task is too complex, break it down into smaller sub-tasks that are manageable.
