Welcome to my personal website, where I share insights and explorations on programming, software architecture, and beyond.

While there is some self-promotion here, my primary goal is to document ideas,
refine thinking, and provide resources for those interested in similar topics.

## Introverted Rebel

I challenge the status quo to drive improvement and positive change.
Entropy and time push us toward transformation—why not steer that change toward something better?

## Latent Artist

Art exists in many forms, not just traditional mediums.
For me, coding is art—a fusion of creativity and logic.
Rick Rubin’s The Creative Act: A Way of Being reinforced this perspective:
every aspect of life can be approached with an artistic mindset, from problem-solving to communication.

## Practicing Stoic

Stoicism teaches focus on what we can control and acceptance of what we cannot.
It helps me navigate complexity with clarity and resilience.
I choose which problems to tackle and which to release, aiming for tranquility and effectiveness.

## What I Do

I specialize in solving complex problems.

- Challenges can be technical, organizational, or strategic.
- While I enjoy technical problem-solving most, I understand that root causes are often non-technical.
- My approach emphasizes context and uncovering the real issues behind the symptoms.
- Asking the right questions is often more valuable than having immediate answers—it drives deeper understanding.

I design and deliver solutions that create measurable business value.  
Technology and tools are secondary to outcomes and impact.

The most difficult—and most critical—steps are identifying the real problems, understanding the environment,  
and selecting the right strategies and technologies.
This requires close collaboration with stakeholders and teams, and the ability to ask questions that lead to actionable insights.

Pragmatic solutions consistently outperform overly complex or purely theoretical ones.

I have served as developer, technical lead, architect, and consultant.
My experience spans .NET, JVM, Go, cloud and on-premises architectures, relational and NoSQL databases, and more.
