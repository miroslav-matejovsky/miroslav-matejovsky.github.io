Welcome to my personal website where I share my thoughts, notes, and articles about software programming,
software architecture, and more.

## Introverted Rebel

Rebelling for the sake of improvement and positive change. Thinking differently and challenging the status quo.
Arrow of entropy and time is always pushing us to change, so why not direct it towards better things?

## Latent Artist

Art can be found in many forms, not just traditional mediums. I see coding as a form of art where creativity meets logic.
I realized this when I read "The Creative Act: A Way of Being" by Rick Rubin.
Every aspect of life can be approached with an artistic mindset, from problem-solving to communication.

## Practicing Stoic

Stoicism teaches us to focus on what we can control and accept what we cannot.
It helps me navigate the complexities of life and work with a clear mind and steady heart.
I choose which problems to tackle and which to let go, aiming for tranquility and resilience.

## What I Do

I like to write code and deliver solutions that bring value and solve real problems.
It is not that important which role, programming language or technology I use,
but rather the outcome and impact of the work.

I've learned that the hardest part is identifying the real problems to solve, understanding the context,
and choosing the right tools and approaches.

Pragmatic solutions are often the most effective, even if they are not the most elegant or sophisticated.

I've worked in various roles including developer, technical lead, architect, and consultant.
My technical journey spans .NET, JVM, and Go, Cloud and On Premises, relational and NoSQL databases, and more.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss any of the topics covered here.
