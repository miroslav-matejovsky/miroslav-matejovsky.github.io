## Complexity is Inevitable

Software systems are inherently complex due to their nature and the environments they operate in.
By observation I have found some types of complexity that can be found in most systems:

### Essential Complexity

### Accidental Complexity

### Latent Complexity

### Complexity by Design

### Complexity by Ignorance
