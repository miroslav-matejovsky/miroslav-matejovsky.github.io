- Between lines of code, documentation whispers secrets of intent to human seekers,
  while revealing patterns to digital minds that shape their answers.

- Everyone has a personal communication interface exposed for others.
  It is just usually poorly documented, non-discoverable and it handles failures poorly.
  Define quality attributes important for you and adjust your own interface accordingly.

- Your internal state is only yours, it has exactly zero impact outside its boundaries.
  What is only important is how you expose it and how you interact with others.

- The most expensive resource is time.
  Time of users, customers, maintainers, developers, coworkers and yours. Use it wisely.

- The problem with inheritance is that (technical) debt is inherited as well.
