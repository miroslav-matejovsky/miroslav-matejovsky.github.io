description: What we can learn from Stoicism in Software Architecture and Engineering.
---

Stoicism is an ancient philosophy that teaches us to focus on what we can control and accept what we cannot.

In software architecture and engineering, we almost never have full control over the environment, requirements, or user behavior.
This leads to uncertainty and complexity.
Stoicism teaches us to navigate this uncertainty with a clear mind and a focus on what we can influence.

We can control what we put in our code, how we design our systems, what metrics we monitor,
and how our systems respond to failures.
We can influence our team, stakeholders, and users by accepting their requests,
and educating them about the implications of their choices.

In summary, Stoicism offers valuable lessons for software architects and engineers.
