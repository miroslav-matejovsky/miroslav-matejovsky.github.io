| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ARP Spoofing            | Forging ARP messages to associate attacker’s MAC with a victim’s IP.        |
| Bluejacking             | Sending unsolicited messages over Bluetooth to nearby devices.              |
| Bluesnarfing            | Unauthorized access to information from a Bluetooth device.                 |
| Botnet                  | Network of compromised hosts remotely controlled to launch attacks.         |
| DDoS (Distributed DoS)  | Multiple systems overwhelming a target to make services unavailable.        |
| DNS Poisoning           | Corrupting DNS data to redirect traffic to malicious sites.                 |
| DoS (Denial-of-Service) | Overwhelming a target system or service to make it unavailable.             |
| Eavesdropping           | Intercepting network traffic to capture information in transit.             |
| Evil Twin               | Rogue wireless AP impersonating a legitimate one to capture traffic.        |
| IP Spoofing             | Forging source IP addresses to hide identity or bypass filters.             |
| Jamming                 | Intentionally emitting radio noise to disrupt wireless communications.      |
| MAC Flooding            | Overloading a switch’s CAM table to force traffic to be broadcast.          |
| Man-in-the-Middle       | Intercepting and possibly altering communication between two parties.       |
| Password Attacks        | Guessing or cracking passwords (brute-force, dictionary, credential reuse). |
| Pharming                | Redirecting users to fake sites without their knowledge.                    |
| Phishing                | Fraudulent messages to trick users into revealing sensitive information.    |
| Replay Attack           | Capturing and reusing valid data transmissions to gain unauthorized access. |
| Session Hijacking       | Taking over an active session by stealing or predicting session tokens.     |
| Smurf Attack            | Spoofed ICMP to broadcast addresses to flood a victim with replies.         |
| War Dialing             | Scanning phone numbers to find modems or remote access systems.             |
| War Driving             | Searching for wireless networks by moving through an area with a receiver.  |
