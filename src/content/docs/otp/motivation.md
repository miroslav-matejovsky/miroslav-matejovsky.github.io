title: Motivation
Description: Why I am gravitating towards OTP/BEAM for building scalable and maintainable applications.
---

- Experience from production systems deployed on customer infrastructure and cloud.
- Hard to find source of problems when things go wrong.
- Hard to reason about system behavior under load.
- Hard to investigate on live system when you don't own the infrastructure.

## Erlang

- Language itself is not very elegant.
- Syntax is not very friendly.
- Lacks modern language features.
- Dynamic language with some static analysis tools like Dialyzer.

## Elixir

- More modern language.
- More friendly syntax.
- Better tooling and ecosystem.
- Dynamic language with some static analysis tools like Dialyzer, same as Erlang.

## Beam

- Type safety and immutability.
- Does not have REPL for now (2025-10-04): <https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/issues/25>
- Potential limitations due to dynamic nature of Erlang/Elixir.
